Question 1:
Your client who is a retailer, wants to run a targeted marketing campaign. They believe that the biggest opportunity is to send a $5 discount offer to customers who shop inconsistently.
 
In past campaigns they have achieved the following results:
- 10% offer response rate (i.e. 1 in 10 customers who get an offer use it)
- 5% incremental spend (i.e. when a customer uses the offer, they spend an extra 5% on that transaction)
- Each time the retailer sends an offer to a customer; it costs them $1
- Each time a customer uses the offer; it costs the retailer $5 

Step 1: Calculate the consistency of each customer
Step 2: Calculate the value of each customer
Step 3: Determine the Target Customer Segment
Step 4: Calculate ROI

Question 2:
Based on your analysis, is targeting inconsistent customers a good idea? What could they do differently to make it a better idea? What other analysis would you recommend?
